## Docker
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) is an open-source platform designed to automate the deployment of applications inside lightweight, portable containers. Containers package an application and its dependencies together, ensuring consistency across development, testing, and production environments.

With Docker, you can:

- Build, ship, and run applications in isolated environments.
- Simplify application deployment and scaling.
- Use pre-built images from Docker Hub or create custom ones.
- Ensure compatibility across different systems by standardizing the runtime environment.

Docker's containerization approach enhances efficiency, reduces overhead, and accelerates software delivery.
