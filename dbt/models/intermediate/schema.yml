    description: >
      Refines and standardizes weather data by transforming the staging table (stg_weather) into a clean, 
      consistent intermediate table (int_weather). 
      It maps multilingual and inconsistent country and city names to standardized English values, 
      filters out duplicate records to retain only the most relevant entry for each date, 
      country, and city, and selects key weather, air quality, and astronomical metrics. 
      The resulting dataset ensures high-quality, deduplicated, and analytics-ready weather data for downstream use.
