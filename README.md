## **Problem Description:**

The Global Weather Repository dataset, available on Kaggle, provides a wealth of weather-related information from various locations over time. While it is a valuable resource, using such a dataset directly in analytical and decision-making applications poses several challenges:

1. **Data Inconsistencies**: The dataset may include missing values, inaccuracies, or inconsistencies in formats, which hinder seamless analysis and insights extraction.
2. **Data Integration**: Weather data often needs to be combined with other datasets (e.g., demographic or environmental data) to unlock its full potential. However, the lack of a structured integration approach can limit its usability.
3. **Scalability**: As weather data grows in volume and complexity, traditional systems struggle to store, process, and query it efficiently.
4. **Accessibility**: Stakeholders often require the data in specific formats or aggregated views for operational use, which is challenging without a robust pipeline.
5. **Real-Time Processing**: For applications like weather forecasting or disaster response, it is essential to enable real-time data ingestion and transformation, which the current dataset usage might not support directly.

This project aims to design and implement a scalable, efficient data engineering pipeline for the Global Weather Repository dataset. The pipeline will ensure:
- Automated ingestion of the dataset from Kaggle.
- Cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing or inconsistent data.
- Transformation of the data into standardized formats suitable for analysis.
- Integration with other datasets to enrich insights.
- Storage in a scalable system, such as cloud-based data warehouses or data lakes.
- Ready accessibility for analytics, visualization, and machine learning models.

By addressing these challenges, the pipeline will enhance the usability of the Global Weather Repository dataset, supporting applications ranging from climate research to operational decision-making.
